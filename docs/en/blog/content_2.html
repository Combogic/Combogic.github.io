Is tire pressure checked regularly? Are maintenance and oil changes carried out as planned? Fleet company culture and operational efficiency have a direct impact on fleet fuel consumption and carbon emissions performance.</p></li><li><p>Strategic Level: At this level, managers must decide "how to get from point A to point B" while maintaining performance, safety, and carbon footprint. Managers need to comprehensively consider parameters such as path length, traffic flow, terrain and road types, and the number of intersections and curves, and choose the path with the lowest fuel consumption and carbon emissions in accordance with the type of fleet vehicles, while taking into account the time efficiency.</p><p>It is almost impossible for the human brain to calculate these parameters at one time. At this time, information technology - big data analysis and GIS layer information are very good assistants. Combustion Technology's CHAP-V system also uses big data analysis to screen out low or high carbon emission paths in a large number of geographic layer data, decouple behavior trend factors, and accurately determine the optimal path.</p></li><li><p>Operation: When you have properly operated and maintained your fleet, and have selected a good path, the driver's operation is the last key. Did you press the accelerator hard? Are you anxious? Is it idling for a long time? Traditional management methods are difficult to analyze in detail, but with GPS vehicle behavior data, it is possible to analyze whether drivers follow the green driving technical guidance with an accuracy in seconds.</p></li></ol><p>In the past, it was difficult to apply the concept of "green driving" to enterprise fleets, mainly because the traditional management method can only see the fuel consumption performance of the fleet from the fuel list and pound list. The data resolution is low, and it is difficult to see where to start. Start optimizing.</p><p>The CHAP-V system launched by Combogic Tech. is committed to solving the problem of fleet carbon management. It uses high-precision GPS vehicle behavior data, GIS geographic layer information, and unsupervised AI big data analysis, allowing technology to replace the human brain for complex tasks, such as Computing data-driven optimization for fleet management.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="blog" class="com-content bg-slate-200"><h3 class="com-container com-title mx-auto">more articles</h3><div class="swiper-container"><div id="blogSwiper" class="swiper com-container"><div class="swiper-wrapper"><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="com-blog com-block"><div><div><img src="../../img/blog/content_4_cover.jpg" alt="Combogic Tech. is expected to conduct academic exchanges at the Advances in Reliability workshop of Academia Sinica in November" width="443" height="249"></div><div><h3><a href="/blog/content_4.html">Combogic Tech. is expected to conduct academic exchanges at the Advances in Reliability workshop of Academia Sinica in November</a></h3><p>Combogic Tech. will hold an academic exchange at the Advances in Reliability workshop of Academia Sinica in November.
