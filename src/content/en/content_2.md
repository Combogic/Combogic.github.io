title: "Potential to reduce vehicle carbon emissions by 45%! How does the concept of green driving apply to fleet management?"
date: "2022-10-26"
description: "According to EU data, from 1990 to 2019, carbon emission sources such as home, energy, agriculture, and industry have all decreased year by year, but only the “road transport” category of carbon emissions has not decreased but increased. Road carbon emissions is the most difficult part to reduce, and perhaps green driving can be a solution."

    At the end of 2021, the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference formulated the Glasgow Agreement
    (Glasgow), in which 149 countries have committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. "Net-zero" has become a
    global consensus, and governments of various countries have also agreed to reduce carbon emissions. Gradually
    strengthen the strength and propose corresponding policies.
</p>
<p>
    Among many carbon emission sources, "road carbon emission" is the most difficult part to reduce. According to EU
    2019 data, transport carbon emissions are close to a quarter of all carbon emissions, 70% of which come from
    road vehicle transport. From 1990 to 2019, carbon emission sources such as home, energy, agriculture, and
    industry all decreased year by year. Only the "road transportation" category of carbon emissions increased
    instead of decreasing.

    As an international model student of carbon reduction, the European Union is facing such a problem. In other
    countries, the carbon emission of transportation roads is a big challenge that is difficult to deal with. Part
    of the reason is that many of the carbon emissions from road transport come from civilian vehicles,
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps "green driving" could be a solution.

<h2>
    What is Green Driving?
</h2>
<p>
    The concept of green driving (eco-driving) was first seen in Switzerland and Finland, and gradually popularized
    in European countries in the early 21st century. It is a driving skill that pursues the lowest unnecessary fuel
    consumption, improves road driving safety and reduces the risk of accidents.
</p>
<p>
    The concept of green driving in a narrow sense refers to "good behavior", which means that vehicle drivers can
    use artificial technology to minimize unnecessary fuel consumption, so that every drop of gasoline can be used
    efficiently.
</p>
<p>
    The concept of green driving in a broad sense covers "good routes" and "good vehicles", which means the goal of
    low-carbon emissions in vehicle and route selection.
</p>

<h2>
    Green driving carbon reduction benefits up to 45%
</h2>
<p>
    In terms of theory, many studies have pointed out that only focusing on improving driver behavior (green driving
    in the narrow sense) can effectively reduce vehicle fuel consumption by 15-25% and reduce carbon emissions by at
    least 30%.

<h2>
    Green driving technology can help enterprise fleet management
</h2>
<p>
    There are also many successful
    <a href="https://llufb.llu.lv/conference/economic_science_rural/2015/Latvia_ESRD_40_2015-132-140.pdf">
        cases
    </a>
    in enterprise fleet management applications, such as The Swiss Canon company's fleet of 350 vehicles reduces
    fuel consumption by 6.1% and reduces the accident rate by 35% after receiving green driving training. On
    average, each vehicle can travel 22% more distance between accidents.
</p>
<p>
    Germany's HAMBURGER WASSERWERKE water public works team reduced their overall fuel consumption by 6% and reduced
    road accident damage costs by more than 25% after an 11-month green driving training program.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of the
    <a href="https://sigmatechnology.com/case/route-optimization-algorithm/">
        hackathon project
    </a>
    initiated by SIGMA in Sweden, the participating teams used SAS Viya analysis, to find the lowest carbon emission
    path, help EI-Kresten waste recycling industry fleet reduce carbon emissions by 24%.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of operation, green driving can bring quite amazing benefits. According to DriverFocus, a road risk
    management company in Dublin,
    <a href="https://www.driverfocus.ie/drivingcosts">
        calculated
    </a>, that in addition to reducing fuel consumption by an average of 7.5% per year, fleets using green driving techniques
    will also The maintenance cost and insurance cost are reduced by 20%, the accident rate is reduced by about 25%, and the total
    cost of each vehicle can be saved by 1,000 euros per year.
</p>
<p>
    The above does not include the value that the reduced carbon emissions can bring in the carbon credit market in
    the future after being certified by the regulatory authority.

<h2>
    How can companies use the concept of green driving to optimize fleet management?
</h2>
<p>
    Effective green driving fleet management has three levels:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Operational aspects: For example, is the vehicle selected with low fuel consumption? Is tire pressure
            checked regularly? Are maintenance and oil changes carried out as planned? Fleet company culture and
            operational efficiency have a direct impact on fleet fuel consumption and carbon emissions performance.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Strategic Level: At this level, managers must decide "how to get from point A to point B" while
            maintaining performance, safety, and carbon footprint. Managers need to comprehensively consider
            parameters such as path length, traffic flow, terrain and road types, and the number of intersections
            and curves, and choose the path with the lowest fuel consumption and carbon emissions in accordance with
            the type of fleet vehicles, while taking into account the time efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is almost impossible for the human brain to calculate these parameters at one time. At this time,
            information technology - big data analysis and GIS layer information are very good assistants.
            Combustion Technology's CHAP-V system also uses big data analysis to screen out low or high carbon
            emission paths in a large number of geographic layer data, decouple behavior trend factors, and
            accurately determine the optimal path.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Operation: When you have properly operated and maintained your fleet, and have selected a good path, the
            driver's operation is the last key. Did you press the accelerator hard? Are you anxious? Is it idling
            for a long time? Traditional management methods are difficult to analyze in detail, but with GPS vehicle
            behavior data, it is possible to analyze whether drivers follow the green driving technical guidance
            with an accuracy in seconds.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    In the past, it was difficult to apply the concept of "green driving" to enterprise fleets, mainly because the
    traditional management method can only see the fuel consumption performance of the fleet from the fuel list and
    pound list. The data resolution is low, and it is difficult to see where to start. Start optimizing.
</p>
<p>
    The CHAP-V system launched by Combogic Tech. is committed to solving the problem of fleet carbon management. It
    uses high-precision GPS vehicle behavior data, GIS geographic layer information, and unsupervised AI big data
    analysis, allowing technology to replace the human brain for complex tasks, such as Computing data-driven
    optimization for fleet management.
